## Welcome to cpp_lore!

> **"I'm bad at C++, but I love it a lot."** - Also me.

This repository is a testament to my undying love for C++, despite our complicated relationship. Here, I've tried to create some top-class C++ projects. Whether they are actually "top-class" or just a glorious mess of `segmentation faults` and `undefined behavior` is up to you to decide.
